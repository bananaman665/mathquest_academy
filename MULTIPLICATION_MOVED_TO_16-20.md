# Multiplication Moved to Levels 16-20

## Changes Made

### Curriculum Restructure

**OLD Structure:**
- Levels 16-20: Addition & Subtraction within 20 (mixed operations)
- Levels 31-35: Multiplication Basics (times tables)

**NEW Structure:**
- Levels 16-20: **Multiplication Basics** (times tables)
- Levels 31-35: Addition & Subtraction within 20 (moved from 16-20)

## Updated Levels

### Levels 16-20 (Now Multiplication):
- **Level 16**: Introduction to Multiplication (1-5 range)
- **Level 17**: Times Tables 2, 5, 10
- **Level 18**: Times Tables 3, 4, 6
- **Level 19**: Times Tables 7, 8, 9
- **Level 20**: All Times Tables (1-12)

### Levels 31-35 (Now Addition/Subtraction):
- **Level 31**: Addition 11-20
- **Level 32**: Subtraction 11-20
- **Level 33**: Mixed Operations 1-20
- **Level 34**: Word Problems 1-20
- **Level 35**: Practice 1-20

## Randomizer Logic Updated

The "mixed" operation randomizer has been updated to reflect the new curriculum:

**Before:** Multiplication included in levels 31+
**After:** Multiplication included in levels 16+

This means:
- Levels 1-15: Mixed operations = addition + subtraction only
- Levels 16+: Mixed operations = all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

## Impact

Students will now learn multiplication earlier in their math journey:
- ✅ Multiplication taught at Level 16 (instead of Level 31)
- ✅ Earlier exposure to times tables
- ✅ More time to practice multiplication throughout remaining levels
