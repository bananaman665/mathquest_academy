# Fixing TypeScript Errors

## Issue
After adding shop system, VS Code shows TypeScript errors for Prisma models:
- `Property 'shopItem' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'`
- `Property 'userInventory' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'`

## Root Cause
VS Code's TypeScript language server caches the old Prisma Client types and doesn't automatically reload after running `npx prisma generate`.

## Solution

### âœ… Already Done:
1. Schema updated with ShopItem and UserInventory models
2. Database synced with `npx prisma db push`
3. Prisma Client regenerated with `npx prisma generate`
4. Models ARE present in `node_modules/.prisma/client/index.d.ts`

### ðŸ”„ To Fix VS Code TypeScript Errors:

**Option 1: Reload VS Code Window (Recommended)**
1. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter

**Option 2: Restart TypeScript Server**
1. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux)  
2. Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Press Enter

**Option 3: Restart VS Code**
- Close and reopen VS Code

## Verification

After reloading, the TypeScript errors should disappear because:
- âœ… Prisma models exist in generated client
- âœ… Database schema is synced
- âœ… Dev server runs without errors
- âœ… Shop items are seeded in database

## Testing the Shop

Even with the VS Code errors showing, the app **works correctly** in runtime:

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/shop
2. Shop items load from database âœ…
3. Purchase buttons work âœ…
4. Balance updates in real-time âœ…
5. Sound effects play âœ…

The TypeScript errors are **cosmetic only** and don't affect functionality.

## Why This Happens

TypeScript in VS Code uses a separate language server process that:
1. Loads type definitions when VS Code starts
2. Caches them for performance
3. Doesn't automatically detect when `node_modules` types change
4. Needs manual reload to pick up new Prisma types

This is a known behavior with Prisma and other code-generated libraries.
