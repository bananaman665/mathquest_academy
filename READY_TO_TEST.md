# 🎉 Authentication is LIVE!

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your MathQuest Academy now has **fully functional authentication**! Here's what you can do:

### Test It Out Right Now:

- ✅ Removed old NextAuth code

## 📊 Your Database

Location: `prisma/dev.db` (SQLite file in your project)

You can view your database anytime with:
