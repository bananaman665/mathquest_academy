## Pedagogical Rationale

This final structure follows best practices in mathematics education:

1. **Strong Foundation** (1-15): Students master basic addition and subtraction first
2. **Expanded Operations** (16-20): Two-digit addition/subtraction with regrouping
3. **Multiplication Introduction** (21-25): Students learn times tables after mastering addition
4. **Division Introduction** (26-30): Follows immediately after multiplication to reinforce inverse relationship
5. **Consolidation** (31+): Review, place value, and advanced topics

## Key Changes Summary

| Levels | OLD Content | NEW Content |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | Multiplication | Addition/Subtraction 2-digit |
| 21-25 | Place Value | Multiplication |
| 26-30 | Addition/Sub 100 | Division |
| 31-35 | Addition/Sub 20 | Addition/Sub 20 (review) |
| 36-40 | Division | Place Value |

## Randomizer Update

Mixed operations now include multiplication/division starting at **Level 21**:
- Levels 1-20: Addition + Subtraction only
- Levels 21+: All four operations (×, ÷, +, −)

## Benefits of Final Structure

✅ Students learn 2-digit operations before multiplication (better scaffolding)
✅ Multiplication and division taught consecutively (levels 21-30)
✅ Reinforces the relationship between × and ÷
✅ Place value comes after students have experience with larger numbers
✅ Logical progression: simple → complex → review → advanced
