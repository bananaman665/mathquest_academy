# Shop System - Deployment Notes

## Status: âœ… Deployed

The shop system has been fully implemented and should be live on Vercel.

## Deployment Checklist:
- [x] Database schema updated with ShopItem and UserInventory models
- [x] Shop items seeded in production database
- [x] API route created at `/api/shop/purchase`
- [x] Client component created with full interactivity
- [x] Code pushed to GitHub
- [x] Vercel auto-deployment triggered

## If Shop Doesn't Work on Mobile:

1. **Check Vercel Deployment Status**
   - Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Verify latest deployment succeeded
   - Check deployment logs for errors

2. **Verify API Route**
   - Test: `curl https://mathquest-academy-bhfd.vercel.app/api/shop/purchase`
   - Should return 401 (unauthorized) not 404

3. **Force Redeploy**
   - Push an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deploy"`
   - Or redeploy from Vercel dashboard

## Database Verification

The shop tables exist in production database because we used:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

This updates the shared Prisma database used by both local and Vercel.

## Testing

**Local (works):** http://localhost:3000/shop
**Production:** https://mathquest-academy-bhfd.vercel.app/shop

Both should show functional shop with working purchases!
