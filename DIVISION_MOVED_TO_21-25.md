# Division Moved to Levels 21-25

## Changes Made

### Curriculum Restructure - Complete Update

**NEW Structure (After All Changes):**
- **Levels 16-20**: Multiplication Basics (times tables)
- **Levels 21-25**: Division Basics (÷)
- **Levels 26-30**: Addition & Subtraction within 100
- **Levels 31-35**: Addition & Subtraction within 20 (mixed operations)
- **Levels 36-40**: Place Value

**OLD Structure:**
- Levels 16-20: Addition & Subtraction within 20
- Levels 21-25: Place Value
- Levels 31-35: Multiplication Basics
- Levels 36-40: Division Basics

## Updated Levels in Detail

### Levels 21-25 (Now Division):
- **Level 21**: Introduction to Division
  - Fair share problems, group maker, multiple choice
  - No remainders
- **Level 22**: Division by 2, 5, 10
  - Division machine, multiple choice, type answer
  - No remainders
- **Level 23**: Division Facts
  - All division facts through 12
  - No remainders
- **Level 24**: Division with Remainders
  - Introduces remainder concept
  - Allows remainders
- **Level 25**: Multiplication & Division Practice
  - Mixed operations combining both concepts
  - Reinforces relationship between mult/div

### Levels 36-40 (Now Place Value):
- **Level 36**: Tens and Ones
- **Level 37**: Counting by 10s
- **Level 38**: Compare 2-Digit Numbers

## Curriculum Flow

The new curriculum follows a logical progression:
1. **Basic Operations** (Levels 1-15): Addition & Subtraction basics
2. **Multiplication** (Levels 16-20): Times tables 2-12
3. **Division** (Levels 21-25): Division basics, remainders, practice
4. **Advanced Addition/Subtraction** (Levels 26-30): Two-digit numbers, regrouping
5. **Review** (Levels 31-35): More practice with early operations
6. **Place Value** (Levels 36-40): Understanding number structure
7. **Fractions** (Levels 41-45): Introduction to fractions
8. **Advanced Topics** (Levels 46-50): Decimals, money, time, measurement

## Benefits

✅ Students learn multiplication and division together (closer proximity)
✅ Better scaffolding - mult/div taught before advanced addition/subtraction
✅ Division taught right after multiplication reinforces inverse relationship
✅ Place value moved to later levels where it supports larger number work
